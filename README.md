## Application Goals

1. To provide a platform for users interested in computer science to intuitively and interactively learn data structures, algorithms, and fundamental computer science concepts through browser-based visualizations. 

2. To guide users through learning paths to introduce real world problems and how they can be solved with classic CS algorithms and essential details for each algorithm to gain intuition.
